== Name

tfenv - manage your application's Terraform environment

== Synopsis

*tfenv* _<command>_ [_<args>_...]

== Description

tfenv respects the _.terraform-version_ file in a project directory by making sure that any *terraform*, or other Terraform command invocation, automatically invokes the Terraform version configured for that project.

It does so by generating shims for all Terraform executables. As long as tfenv shims directory is prepended to PATH, tfenv automatically ensures transparent switching between Terraform versions.

tfenv looks for available Terraform versions in the _$TFENV_ROOT/versions_ directory.

== Commands

*tfenv global* [_<version>_]::
  View or change the global Terraform version

*tfenv local* [_<version>_]::
  View or change the local Terraform version

*tfenv shell* [_<version>_]::
  View or change the Terraform version for the current shell session

*tfenv version*::
  View the currently active Terraform version and where it is set from

*tfenv versions*::
  List all locally installed Terraform versions known to tfenv

*tfenv rehash*::
  Regenerate shims for all known Terraform executables

*tfenv init*::
  Help bootstrap tfenv into the current shell environment

*tfenv help* [_<command>_]::
  View help text for any tfenv command

== Environment Variables

*TFENV_VERSION* (default: read from _.terraform-version_ file)::
  The Terraform version name to be used

*TFENV_ROOT* (default: _~/.tfenv_)::
  The location where tfenv discovers Terraform versions, plugins, and other configuration

*TFENV_DEBUG*::
  Activates printing debug information about tfenv internals to standard error

*TFENV_HOOK_PATH*::
  Colon-separated list of paths searched for tfenv plugin scripts

*TFENV_DIR* (default: _$PWD_)::
  Directory to traverse bottom-up to locate the _.terraform-version_ file

== Plugins

As its core functionality, tfenv only switches between Terraform versions and does nothing else, but offers a plugin mechanism to hook into and override almost any aspect of its default behavior.
